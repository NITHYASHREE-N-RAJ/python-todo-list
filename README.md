# Python Tkinter To-Do List App

A simple graphical To-Do List application built with Python’s Tkinter library. This app allows users to add tasks, remove tasks, and mark tasks as done with a checkmark. Tasks are saved locally in a text file (`tasks.txt`) so they persist between sessions.

## Features

- Add new tasks  
- Remove existing tasks  
- Mark tasks as done (adds a ✔️ mark)  
- Tasks are saved and loaded automatically from `tasks.txt`  
- Simple and user-friendly graphical interface  

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).  
2. Download or clone this repository.  
3. Run the app from the terminal or command prompt:

   python todo_gui.py
